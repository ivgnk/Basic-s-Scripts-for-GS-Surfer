The Grid Blank command is used to remove grid node data from a grid in areas not supported by original data or in areas where you do not want to display contours on a map. Blanking assigns a blanking code to specified groups of grid nodes in a blanked grid file. Blanked grids contain the same number of grid nodes and the same grid limits as the original grid file. The grid nodes in the blanked grid are identical to the values in the original grid except in those locations where the blanking values are assigned. 

Blanking boundaries are defined in a blanking file, which is a special ASCII format file containing the XY coordinates defining the boundary. Blanking files can be made in the Surfer worksheet. Blanking can be assigned to areas inside or outside the blanking boundary
